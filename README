Welcome to FreeBSD!


this is a general roadmap to learn the starting points all 
the way to the end in a general sense as a FreeBSD user new to UNIX.

For the very first few steps start by installing FreeBSD on either 
a virtual machine, or on real hardware, refer to the handbook and most importantly; have fun!

in the FreeBSD community, we refer to the handbook as the bible of FreeBSD:
every info you need as a user should be there.

start by installing an alternative shell to sh, and writing some scripts.

resources on shell writing exist in the resources/shell folder on the local directory
